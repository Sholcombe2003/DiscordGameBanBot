# DiscordGameBanBot
Simple Discord bot that watches over useres activity in a server and if the users activity matches the key word the bot will ban the user with a custom message

If you wish to use this bot all you have to do is get your own discord developer API key for a bot, then paste that in the bot start up where I labled "Your Key Here".
Then go into bot commands and change the game name to whatever you'd like it to be and then run the bot startup in an IDE or compile the project to a jar and then run it!
